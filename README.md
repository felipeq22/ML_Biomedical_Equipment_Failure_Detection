MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
2.1. DATABASE ACQUISITION
Medical Companies has been known as one of the global leaders in the medical equipment market. In order to ensure that their services are organized and well-directed, they must have a consolidated information system. Therefore, obtaining a database regarding the historical activities of the equipment was not a major complication, as this information is available in their system. The downloaded historical database of their equipment and covered the period from January 2010 to September 2021.
2.2. PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DOWNLOAD AND LEARNING
To execute the programming of the ML model, Anaconda3 and subsequently Spyder had to be installed. Spyder is an IDE that supports the Python programming language. The version of Python used in this programming was 3.8.8. Once the programs were downloaded, it was necessary to understand the functioning of the Python language and, especially, the libraries that will be mentioned in chapter 3.

2.3. DATA CLEANING AND FEATURE ENGINEERING
In order to understand the database provided by Siemens Healthineers, an exploration of the data must be conducted, followed by a cleaning process. This is necessary because certain fields may contain noise, which can hinder the ML models from learning correctly. After this, a feature engineering process is performed, which involves organizing and working with the clean data to prepare it for training and evaluating the models.

2.4. GENERATION OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
To achieve the overall objective, ML models were generated using the database that contains annotations regarding the types of activities performed the medical equipment. These annotations indicate whether the equipment has undergone preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, calibration, software updates, among others. Supervised learning techniques were employed in this process.
